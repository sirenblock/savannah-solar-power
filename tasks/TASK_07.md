## Your Mission
Create a dedicated Enphase IQ8 systems page showcasing our Enphase expertise and certification as an Enphase installer.

## Company Context
**Savannah Solar Power (C SQUARED POWER LLC)** - Enphase Platinum Installer. Enphase IQ8 microinverters are our default inverter choice for residential solar installations.

## Page Content Structure

### 1. Hero Section
**Headline:** "Enphase IQ8 Solar Systems | Savannah, GA"
**Subheading:** "Enphase Platinum Installer. The most reliable, efficient, and advanced solar technology available."
**Badge:** "Enphase Platinum Installer"
**CTA:** "Get Your Free Enphase Solar Quote"

### 2. Why Enphase IQ8

**Industry's #1 Microinverter:**
"Enphase is the world's leading microinverter manufacturer. Over 3 million systems installed worldwide. Proven reliability, industry-best warranty, and cutting-edge technology."

**Our Default Choice:**
"We install Enphase IQ8 microinverters as our standard inverter solution. Why? Superior reliability, 25-year warranty, panel-level optimization, and future-proof technology."

**Panel-Level Intelligence:**
"Unlike traditional string inverters, each solar panel gets its own Enphase microinverter. This means:
- Maximum energy harvest from every panel
- No single point of failure
- Shade on one panel doesn't affect others
- Real-time monitoring of each panel
- Superior safety with no high-voltage DC on your roof"

**Grid-Forming Technology:**
"IQ8 series microinverters can form a microgrid during outages - a revolutionary feature called Sunlight Backup. Your solar keeps working even when the grid is down (when paired with Enphase IQ Batteries)."

### 3. Enphase IQ8 Microinverter Models

**IQ8M (Most Common):**
- **Peak AC Output:** 384W
- **Best For:** 350-420W solar panels
- **Efficiency:** 97.0%
- **Continuous AC Output:** 325W
- **Our Standard:** Used on 90% of our residential installs

**IQ8+ (High Power):**
- **Peak AC Output:** 480W
- **Best For:** 400-500W+ panels
- **Efficiency:** 97.3%
- **Continuous AC Output:** 425W

**IQ8A (Standard Power):**
- **Peak AC Output:** 349W
- **Best For:** 300-380W panels
- **Efficiency:** 96.5%
- **Continuous AC Output:** 295W

### 4. Enphase IQ8 System Features

**25-Year Warranty:**
"Industry-leading 25-year microinverter warranty. That's the same lifespan as your solar panels. No other inverter technology offers this level of coverage."

**Sunlight Backup (IQ8 Series):**
"During grid outages, IQ8 microinverters can power your home using only solar energy during daylight hours - even without batteries. Add Enphase IQ Batteries for 24/7 backup."

**Built for Harsh Environments:**
"Enphase microinverters are sealed against moisture, rated for extreme temperatures (-40°C to +65°C), and perfect for coastal Georgia's salt air and humidity."

**Rapid Shutdown Compliant:**
"Meets all NEC rapid shutdown requirements. Microinverters convert DC to AC right at the panel, so there's no high-voltage DC wiring on your roof. Safer for installers, firefighters, and homeowners."

**No Single Point of Failure:**
"If one microinverter fails (rare), only that panel is affected. Your other panels keep producing. With string inverters, one failure can shut down your entire system."

### 5. Enphase App & Monitoring

**Enlighten App:**
"World-class monitoring on your phone or computer:
- Real-time production monitoring
- Panel-level performance data
- Historical production graphs
- System health alerts
- Energy consumption tracking (with Enphase Consumption Meter)
- Remote troubleshooting capability"

**Homeowner Benefits:**
"See exactly how much energy each panel is producing. Identify shading issues. Track your environmental impact. Monitor your energy independence."

**Installer Benefits:**
"We can remotely diagnose issues without a site visit. Faster troubleshooting. Proactive maintenance. Better customer service."

### 6. Enphase IQ Battery Integration

**Seamless Battery Backup:**
"Enphase IQ8 microinverters integrate perfectly with Enphase IQ Batteries for whole-home backup:
- IQ Battery 3T/5P: 3.3 kWh / 5.0 kWh per unit
- Modular and expandable
- AC-coupled for easy installation
- Works with existing Enphase systems"

**Sunlight Backup:**
"Even without batteries, IQ8 microinverters can provide limited backup power during grid outages when the sun is shining. Add batteries for 24/7 protection."

### 7. Why Microinverters vs String Inverters?

**Microinverters Win:**
- ✓ 25-year warranty (vs 10-12 for string)
- ✓ Panel-level optimization
- ✓ No single point of failure
- ✓ Better performance with shade
- ✓ Safer (no high-voltage DC)
- ✓ Easier to expand system
- ✓ Panel-level monitoring
- ✓ Better for complex roof layouts

**String Inverters:**
- Shorter warranty
- One inverter for all panels
- Shade on one panel reduces entire system output
- High-voltage DC on roof
- Single point of failure
