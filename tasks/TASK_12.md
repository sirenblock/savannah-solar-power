# PAGE 1: FINANCING & INCENTIVES

## Page Content Structure

### 1. Hero Section
**Headline:** "Solar Financing & Incentives | Make Solar Affordable"
**Subheading:** "Save thousands with the 30% federal tax credit. Flexible financing options make solar accessible for every budget."

### 2. Federal Solar Tax Credit (ITC)

**30% Federal Investment Tax Credit**

"The federal solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC) is the single biggest financial incentive for going solar. This tax credit reduces your federal income taxes by 30% of your total solar system cost.

**How It Works:**
- Install a solar system in 2024-2032
- System costs $20,000 → You get $6,000 tax credit
- Tax credit reduces your federal taxes owed dollar-for-dollar
- Applies to solar panels, inverters, batteries, installation labor, and permitting
- No income limits or caps
- Unused credits can roll over to next tax year

**Timeline:**
- 2024-2032: 30% tax credit
- 2033: 26% tax credit
- 2034: 22% tax credit
- 2035+: Currently scheduled to expire (unless extended)

**Important Notes:**
- This is a TAX CREDIT, not a deduction (much more valuable)
- You must have tax liability to claim it
- Consult your tax professional for specifics
- Battery systems qualify when installed with solar"

### 3. Financing Options

**Option 1: Cash Purchase**

"Pay for your solar system upfront and maximize your savings.

**Pros:**
- Highest total savings over system life
- Full 30% tax credit immediately
- No interest payments
- Immediate ROI tracking
- Typical payback: 6-9 years

**Cons:**
- Requires upfront capital
- Longer payback period

**Best For:** Homeowners with available cash who want maximum long-term savings."

**Example:**
```
System Cost: $20,000
Federal Tax Credit: -$6,000
Net Cost: $14,000
Annual Savings: ~$2,000
Payback: ~7 years
25-Year Savings: ~$36,000
```

---

**Option 2: Solar Loan**

"Finance your solar system with $0 down and own it from day one.

**Pros:**
- $0 down payment options
- Own your system immediately
- Claim 30% tax credit
- Payments often less than current electric bill
- Build equity in your home
- Fixed monthly payment (unlike utility bills)

**Cons:**
- Interest charges reduce total savings vs cash
- Monthly payment obligation

**Best For:** Most homeowners. Great balance of affordability and ownership.

**Loan Terms:**
- 10, 15, 20, or 25-year terms
- Rates typically 3.99% - 7.99% (based on credit)
- $0 down or small down payment
- No prepayment penalties
- Unsecured (no home lien) or secured options"

**Example (20-year loan at 5.99%):**
```
System Cost: $20,000
Monthly Payment: ~$143
Federal Tax Credit: $6,000 (you keep this)
Net Cost Over 20 Years: ~$28,320
Estimated Electric Bill Savings: ~$40,000
Net Savings: ~$11,680
```

---

**Option 3: Home Equity Loan/HELOC**

"Use your home's equity to finance solar.

**Pros:**
- Often lowest interest rates (currently 6-9%)
- Interest may be tax-deductible (consult tax pro)
- Flexible terms
- Full 30% solar tax credit

**Cons:**
- Home is collateral
- May have closing costs
- Reduces home equity

**Best For:** Homeowners with substantial equity seeking lowest interest rates."

---

**Option 4: Commercial Financing**

"For business solar installations:

**Options:**
- Commercial solar loans
- Equipment financing
- Sale-leaseback (for larger projects)
- Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs)

**Tax Benefits:**
- 30% federal ITC
- MACRS depreciation (recover 85% of cost in Year 1)
- State/local incentives

**Contact us for commercial financing consultation.**"

### 4. Georgia-Specific Incentives

**Georgia Net Metering:**
"Georgia Power and EMCs offer net metering - credit for excess solar energy sent to the grid. Your meter runs backward (figuratively) when you overproduce. Credits offset energy drawn at night or cloudy days."

**Property Tax Exemption:**
"Georgia law exempts solar systems from property tax assessments. Your home value increases, but property taxes don't."

**Georgia Power Programs:**
Check current Georgia Power renewable energy programs (these change).

**Sales Tax:**
Solar equipment installations are subject to Georgia sales tax, but the overall value still significantly outweighs this cost.

### 5. Return on Investment (ROI)

**Average ROI Timeline:**
- **Years 0-7:** Payback period (solar pays for itself)
- **Years 8-25+:** Pure profit (free electricity)
- **Total 25-Year Savings:** $30,000 - $80,000 (depending on system size and rates)

**ROI Factors:**
- System size and cost
- Your electricity consumption
- Current utility rates
- Rate escalation (utilities raise rates ~3-4% annually)
- Financing method
- System performance

### 6. Why Solar Makes Financial Sense

**Hedge Against Rising Rates:**
"Georgia Power rates have increased 30%+ over the past decade. Utility rates will continue rising. Lock in your energy costs for 25+ years."

**Increase Home Value:**
"Studies show solar increases home values by 4-6% on average. A $20,000 solar system can add $20,000-$30,000 to home value."

**Environmental Value:**
"Beyond money, solar offsets tons of CO2 annually - equivalent to planting 100+ trees per year."

### 7. Comparison: Solar vs Utility

**Traditional Electric Bill (Next 25 Years):**
```
Current: $200/month = $2,400/year
With 3.5% annual increase: $96,000 total
```

**With Solar (Loan Example):**
```
Solar Loan: $150/month = $1,800/year (20 years)
Reduced Electric: $40/month = $480/year
Total: $2,280/year (first 20 years)
Years 21-25: $480/year only
25-Year Total: ~$48,000
Savings: ~$48,000
```

**With Solar (Cash):**
```
System Cost: $14,000 (after tax credit)
Reduced Electric: $40/month = $480/year
25-Year Total: ~$26,000
Savings: ~$70,000
```

### 8. How to Get Started

**Step 1:** Schedule free consultation
**Step 2:** Receive custom proposal with financing options
**Step 3:** Choose financing method that fits your budget
**Step 4:** We handle everything else (permits, installation, interconnection)
**Step 5:** Start saving immediately

### 9. Financing FAQs

**Q: Can I use the tax credit as a down payment?**
A: No, the tax credit comes when you file taxes (following year). However, some lenders offer reduced payments in Year 1 assuming you'll apply tax credit.

**Q: What credit score do I need?**
A: Most solar loans require 650+ credit score. Some programs accept lower scores.

**Q: Are there prepayment penalties?**
A: No, our solar loan partners don't charge prepayment penalties.

**Q: What if I sell my house?**
A: With ownership (cash or loan), solar transfers to buyer and increases home value. If you have a loan, you can pay it off at closing or buyer may assume it (with lender approval).
