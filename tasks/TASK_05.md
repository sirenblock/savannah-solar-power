# TASK 05: Battery Backup Page

## Your Mission
Create a comprehensive battery backup systems page explaining all battery solutions, benefits, and applications.

## Company Context
**Savannah Solar Power (C SQUARED POWER LLC)** - Battery backup is critical in coastal Georgia for hurricane preparedness and grid resilience.

## Page Content Structure

### 1. Hero Section
**Headline:** "Solar Battery Backup Systems | Savannah, GA"
**Subheading:** "Never lose power again. Keep your home running during storms and outages with solar battery backup."
**CTA:** "Get Your Free Battery Backup Quote"

### 2. Why Battery Backup is Essential in Coastal Georgia

**Hurricane Preparedness:**
"Savannah faces hurricane threats every year. Extended power outages are common. A battery backup system keeps your essential systems running - refrigeration, AC, medical equipment, and communications - when the grid goes down."

**Grid Resilience:**
"Even without hurricanes, grid outages happen. Storms, accidents, and maintenance cause disruptions. Battery backup provides peace of mind year-round."

**Energy Independence:**
"Store solar energy produced during the day and use it at night or during outages. Reduce reliance on the grid."

**Load Shifting:**
"Use stored energy during peak rate periods. Save money while maintaining power security."

### 3. How Solar + Battery Backup Works

**During Normal Operation:**
- Solar panels generate electricity
- Excess energy charges your battery
- Battery powers your home when solar isn't producing
- Seamless integration with grid connection

**During Power Outages:**
- System detects grid failure instantly (< 10 milliseconds)
- Battery automatically powers your home
- Essential circuits stay online
- Solar continues charging battery during daylight
- You maintain power for days or indefinitely (with solar)

### 5. Backup Configuration Options

**Whole-Home Backup:**
"Powers your entire house including AC, heating, all appliances. Requires larger battery system (typically 2-3 batteries)."

**Critical Loads Backup:**
"Powers essential circuits: refrigerator, lights, outlets, internet, medical equipment. More affordable, longer backup duration with smaller battery."

**Custom Hybrid:**
"Mix of whole-home and critical loads. We prioritize essential loads during outages but can power the whole home when battery is fully charged."

### 6. Adding Battery Backup to Existing Solar

"Already have solar? We can add battery backup to most existing systems, including:
- Enphase microinverter systems (IQ8 series for Sunlight Backup)
- String inverter systems (with AC-coupled batteries)
- Older systems (we can retrofit with modern batteries)

Free consultation to assess your existing system compatibility."

### 7. What's Included in Battery Backup Installation

"Complete battery backup system installation including:
- Site assessment and load calculation
- Battery system sizing and design
- Electrical panel upgrades (if needed)
- Battery installation and mounting
- Backup gateway or automatic transfer switch
- Integration with existing solar (if applicable)
- System programming and configuration
- Permit acquisition and inspections
- Commissioning and testing
- Monitoring system setup
- Training on system operation
- 10-12 year battery warranties
- Ongoing support"

### 8. Battery Backup Incentives

**30% Federal Tax Credit:**
"Battery systems paired with solar qualify for the 30% federal solar tax credit. Save thousands on your battery backup system."

**Net Metering:**
"In Georgia, store energy during the day and export excess to the grid for credits."

### 9. How Long Will My Battery Last During an Outage?

**Example: 13.5 kWh Battery (1 Powerwall)**

**Critical Loads Only (3-5 kW average):**
- Runtime: 8-12 hours per charge
- With solar recharging: Indefinite

**Whole Home (Average 8-10 kW):**
- Runtime: 4-6 hours per charge
- With solar recharging: Multiple days

**Conservative Use (2-3 kW):**
- Runtime: 18-24 hours per charge
- With solar recharging: Indefinite

### 10. Storm Preparation Tips

**Before Hurricane Season:**
- Ensure battery is fully charged
- Test backup circuits
- Update critical load panel if needed
- Review monitoring app

**When Storm Approaches:**
- Charge battery to 100%
- Minimize non-essential use
- Have flashlights ready
- Know how to monitor battery status

**During Outage:**
- Battery automatically takes over
- Solar recharges during daylight
- Monitor battery level on app
- Conserve energy for extended outages
