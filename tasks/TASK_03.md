### 7. Common Residential Questions

**Will solar work on my roof?**
Most roofs are suitable. We work with composition shingle, metal, tile, and flat roofs. Ideal roof pitch is 15-35 degrees facing south, but we've done successful installations on east and west-facing roofs too.

**What about hurricanes?**
All our systems are engineered to withstand hurricane-force winds per Florida Building Code requirements. We use enhanced fastening and structural calculations.

**How long does installation take?**
Most residential systems are installed in 1-3 days.

**What happens to my electric bill?**
You'll still have a grid connection and a small monthly service charge from Georgia Power, but your energy charges drop dramatically - often by 50-80%.
