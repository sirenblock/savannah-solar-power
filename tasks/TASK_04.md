**Headline:** "Commercial Solar Installation in Savannah, GA"
**Subheading:** "Reduce operating costs, enhance your business's sustainability profile, and protect against rising energy prices with commercial solar."
**CTA:** "Get Your Free Commercial Solar Assessment"

### 2. Why Commercial Solar Makes Business Sense

**Immediate Cost Savings:**
"Commercial properties typically have high daytime energy consumption - perfect for solar. Reduce your operating expenses by 30-60% and improve your bottom line."

**Fast ROI:**
"With federal tax credits, accelerated depreciation (MACRS), and high commercial electric rates, typical payback is 4-7 years. Then you enjoy decades of nearly free electricity."

**Tax Benefits:**
- **30% Federal Investment Tax Credit (ITC)**
- **MACRS Depreciation** - Recover 85% of system cost in Year 1
- **Potential state/local incentives**

**Hedge Against Rising Rates:**
"Lock in your energy costs for 25+ years. Eliminate exposure to utility rate increases."

**Sustainability & Brand Value:**
"Demonstrate environmental commitment to customers and employees. Solar is a visible statement about your company's values."

**Energy Independence:**
"Add battery backup for critical operations. Maintain business continuity during grid outages."
